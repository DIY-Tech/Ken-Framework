# Ken Framework

Ken is a simple PHP framework adapted to create custom REST API's. Ken supplies a suite of middleware tools to developers to simplify web application creation. In a nutshell Ken uses a server file to handle requests from a client, the request has to be sent with specific criteria to be able to preform an action.

Actions represent a single operation that a user undertakes, this could be registering an account, logging in, or uploading a file.
